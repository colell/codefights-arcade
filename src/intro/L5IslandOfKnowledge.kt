// 19. Are Equally Strong
// Call two arms equally strong if the heaviest weights they each are able to lift are equal.
// Call two people equally strong if their strongest arms are equally strong (the strongest arm
// can be both the right and the left), and so are their weakest arms.
// Given your and your friend's arms' lifting capabilities find out if you two are equally strong.

// 21. Is IPv4 Address
// An IP address is a numerical label assigned to each device (e.g., computer, printer) participating in a
// computer network that uses the Internet Protocol for communication. There are two versions of the
// Internet protocol, and thus two versions of addresses. One of them is the IPv4 address.
// IPv4 addresses are represented in dot-decimal notation, which consists of four decimal numbers,
// each ranging from 0 to 255 inclusive, separated by dots, e.g., 172.16.254.1.
// Given a string, find out if it satisfies the IPv4 address naming rules.

// 22. Avoid Obstacles

// The pixels in the input image are represented as integers. The algorithm distorts the input image in the
// following way: Every pixel x in the output image has a value equal to the average value of the pixel values
// from the 3 Ã— 3 square that has its center at x, including x itself. All the pixels on the border of x are then removed.
// Return the blurred image as an integer, with the fractions rounded down.
